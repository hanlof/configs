# configs

WARNING: not in a user-friendly state
WARNING: a bunch of experimental stuff included

this is my personal configs for
* git - mostly aliases
* bash - some dmenu interaction for inserting filenames on prompt and jumping to tags in code-trees
         also some f-key mappings, aliases, and custom prompt.
         also some bash functions for grep and find-by-filename in recursive git submodules
* vim - colorscheme (sienna). f-key mappings. dmenu interaction for opening files and jumping to tags
        highlight tabs and bad whitespace
        the fugitive plugin (bless it!)
        misc settings (filetype on, laststatus=2, custom status bar, ignorecase, ...)

also some helper-programs in c that does stuff that are too slow for bash to handle (and that i very much enjoyed optimizing to be highly efficient)
