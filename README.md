# configs

as the initial commit comment states this is a bunch of useful stuff for the shell (bash) and also for vim

there are some experimental things that does not really work

these files are meant to be linked from the real configuration files living in my home directory on whatever linux system i use.
in other words .bashrc in my home is meant to be a softlink to bashrc in the repo. .vimrc in home is supposed to link to vimrc in here etc
