# configs

*WARNING*: not in a user-friendly state

*WARNING*: a bunch of experimental stuff included

this is my personal configs for
* git - mostly aliases
* bash - some dmenu interaction for inserting filenames on prompt and jumping to tags in code-trees
* * also some bash functions for grep and find-by-filename recursively in git submodules
* * also some f-key mappings, aliases, and custom prompt.
* vim - highly personal config stuffs such as colorscheme (sienna) and f-key mappings
* * also some dmenu interaction for opening files and jumping to tags
* * highlight tabs and bad whitespace
* * the fugitive plugin (bless it!)
* * misc settings (filetype on, laststatus=2, custom status bar, ignorecase, ...)

there is also a nice git-aware repo-indexing tool (runs ctags on git indexed stuff. saves a bunch of time compared to looking at everything recursively)

also some helper-programs in c that does stuff that are too slow for bash to handle (and that i very much enjoyed optimizing to be highly efficient)
