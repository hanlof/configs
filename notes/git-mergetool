Objective: launch vim with tabs containing each conflict instead of running vim once for each conflict
Findings: git-mergetool is a bash script that explicitly launches the mergetool once for each conflict
          and waits for it to exit before launching the next one.
          This means that standard git-mergetool can't be used for the objective unless a fake tool is created
          that exits unconditionally except for on the last file. This tool would have to open VIM in another process
          and make sure to NOT exit on the last file. The last file would have to be found by examining the time
          between invocations of the tool. If a certain time has elapsed it would have to assume the last file has been passed.
          The alternative is to modify git-mergetool
          * git mergetool lives under <GIT_BIN_DIR>/../libexec/git-core/mergetools/vimdiff
