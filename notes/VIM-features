tags in quickfix
----------------
getqflist()/setqflist() is the interface to qf window.
some plugins exist. are they good??

git diff in quickfix
--------------------
found the errorformat!
need hooks that act when switching file through quickfix
- might not be possible to add such hooks, can fall back to hooks for switching buffer.
- maybe hook into F7/F8 mappings?
- the hook needs to close the previous fugitive diff window and then perform Gdiff on the newly opened one.
need to know when to remove the hooks. probably needs to be a manual way plus whenever qf contents is changed (QuickFixCmd(Post/Pre) ?!?)
there are QuickFixCmdPre / QuickFixCmdPost hooks!
integrate this stuff into fugitive?! :Gdiff will depend on fugitive anyways
